# Hardware Setup

## Components
- Raspberry Pi
- Raspberry Pi Camera
- Raspberry Pi Camera cable (50cm)
- Adafruit PiTFT 2.2"
- Micro SD card (at least 4GB)
- USB Wifi dongle

## Electronics

The PiTFT comes without a header, so first of all a 2x20 header has to be
soldered to the PiTFT.


Lastly, connect the PiTFT, the Wifi dongle and the camera
to the Raspberry Pi.

For the setup you also need to connect the Raspberry Pi to the internet, a
monitor, and a keyboard.
