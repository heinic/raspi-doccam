# Raspberry Pi Document Camera

This project aims to provide a simple alternative to commercial document
cameras. Document cameras are used for presentations in schools, among many
other things. These devices are often quite expensive and not portable. This is
why commercial document cameras are not suited well for use in a school
environment and why I started this project.

## General
This project is based on the Raspberry Pi Camera and the Adafruit PiTFT.
This camera offers several ways of interaction:
- A live preview sent via HDMI or a network
- A display attached to the Raspberry Pi which also supports user input
- A web based user interface; this can be used in conjunction with many devices.
- Wifi connectivity; the web interface can be used with smartphones, tablets and
  laptops

A major advantage of this document camera is it only requiring a power cable.
All the other connections are optional and not required for effective use. The
power can also be supplied from a USB power bank. This means the camera is
completely portable.
